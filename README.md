# Wotion Mono-Repository

Wotion is a library of fully customizable, dynamic widgets for Notion. Simply copy the link and embed it!
This library will forever be free and open source. I don't believe something simple like external Notion widgets requires the need to collect your data or sell you a plan. 

## Issues

This repository is independently managed. If there is an issue with a widget, please open up an issue ticket and I will take a look. PRs will be denied unless it's a simple fix.

I am always looking for new Widgets to add! If you have a good idea for a useful Widget, feel free to open up an issue or send me an email!

## Self-Hosting

Since the entire app is open source, feel free to clone the project and host widgets on your own server :)

### Startup Instructions

    git clone
    npm install
    npm run dev

I have also included a MongoDB boilerplate. I am using it to collect/store some simple user analytics on the wotion.co production build, but it serves no purpose for the open source version. Feel free to use it :)
